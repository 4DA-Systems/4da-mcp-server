 * what_should_i_know tool
 *
 * Pre-task briefing for AI coding agents, built from the task outward:
 * - the dependencies the task names, with their installed versions, the
 *   version-confirmed vulnerabilities on those versions, releases since, and
 *   how far the requested upgrade jumps;
 * - this project's other version-confirmed findings, counted separately;
 * - recorded decisions and decision windows relevant to the task;
 * - a delegation verdict that ONLY version-confirmed evidence about the task
 *   (or install drift actually running) can raise.
 *
 * Measured 2026-10-01 (live), the old briefing for "bump fastembed 5 -> 7":
 * eleven advisories, none about fastembed — an arXiv dataset paper, three
 * OpenAI-company news items matched to the `openai` npm package of another
 * project, Angular and russh CVEs no project uses — and `human_only`, because
 * any high "security" keyword match anywhere forced it. Feed classifications
 * were ~5-15% precise as security alerts (154 in 14 days; the relevance judge
 * accepted 10). They no longer decide anything here.
